## Prerequisites

* [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

* [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)

For the Angular front-end we'll also use:

* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

* [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/)

If you clone the repo, make sure you setup the database and Entity Framework migrations!
This is how:

In Visual Studio 2019:

1. Remove the contents of the folder Migrations.
2. Then open the Package Manager Console (Tools->Nuget Package Manager->Package Manager Console).
3. Run the following commands:

```
Add-Migration Initial
Update-Database
```

4. Now press F5 and run the application. You will have an empty Product list to start with.

## Debugging
If you get an error message running the app, first make sure you installed node modules using the npm install command.
In VS Code or in the Node.js command prompt, run `npm install` in the MainApp folder.

Make sure you've installed the following as well:
1. Angular CLI using the `npm install -g @angular/cli command`.
2. @angular-devkit/build-angular module using the `npm install --save-dev @angular-devkit/build-angular command`.
